Hi there! My name is Manuel Montesino-SanMartin. I love statistics, math, and
programming. That's the backbone of my diverse research!

I've got a PhD in Climate Change at the University of Copenhagen. My research
looked at the uncertainties in agricultural impact and adaptation assessments
of climate change. Right after, I started exploring the seasonal forecasts of
crop yields using crop models, weather data, and remote sensing. The journey
lead me to deepen into satellite imagery pre-processing at the Public
University of Navarre. This where I've been doing my latest teaching and
research.
